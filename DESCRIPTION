Description: Implements Gaussian copula based estimators for handling endogeneity in linear models, including
    approaches by Park and Gupta (2012), Yang et al. (2025), Hu et al. (2025), Breitung et al. (2024), Haschka (2024),
    Liengaard et al. (2025), and related panel and Bayesian formulations. The package provides tools to estimate
    coefficients, obtain bootstrap-based standard errors, and work with residual diagnostics across cross-sectional,
    panel, and Bayesian settings.
